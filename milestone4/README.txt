Admin Panel dashboard: Providing administrators with the ability to add, delete, update and manage (section like: Our Leader, Gallery, Attendance, Search engine, and others) 
Database:
All database interactions necessary for your system can be broken down into a small subset 
of functionality:
1. Connect to the database
2. Execute a query (return any results)
3. Disconnect from the database

Instead of copy/pasting the same block of code to perform those actions and just changing the SQL statement, consider creating a database class with public methods for each of those
actions.
